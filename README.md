# cornell-leaderboard
You will create both a client and a database. The client is a simple snake game. It is sophisticated enough to help teach you basic C# skills. The database is SQL. With it, you will learn schema and structure as well as some of the basic skills needed to query the data for building a leaderboard. In the end, this project will let you have a game with a leaderboard that is more than just the "top 10" but also analyzes gameplay in a way that makes it fun and potentially predictive.
